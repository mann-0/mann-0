Project Description:
CarbonBalance is a web-based sustainability decision-support system designed to help construction professionals identify the most effective carbon-reducing interventions for their building projects. Users create a project, input building metrics, adjust sustainability theme preferences, and receive dynamically ranked intervention recommendations based on a scoring algorithm. The system allows users to select interventions one at a time, generating new optimised recommendations after each choice. A final report presents all implemented interventions along with a relationship graph illustrating how the selected measures interact. The platform improves transparency, consistency, and efficiency in sustainability planning.
